        Since this is my personal website and you clearly want to know more about me, I will let you in on some personal things about me. 
        I've been using a computer for as long as I can remember. When my family bought a computer for the first time, my mother only taught me how to start it up, I was so young back that I couldn't even get on the desk chair without help.
        Despite that fact, the very next day, I was up before anyone and sitting on that chair, clicking around and being fascinated by everything that revolutionary calculator was printing on its monitor. 
        <span class="font-bold text-orange-600 dark:text-indigo-500">That's how everything started!</span>

        Although I was always dedicated to becoming a software engineer, I did a lot of unrelated stuff that most probably made me the person I am today. I was in the Royal Canadian Sea Cadet program and the Scouts during my teenage years. 
        From 2016 to 2019, I went to summer camps with the Cadet program and learned marksmanship 🔫 and actually got good at it. 
        Also, during my high school years, I had a lot of free time so I used it to learn CGI and VFX. More specifically, I learned After Effects and Cinema 4D 🎥.
        Recently, I very much enjoy going to the gym 🏋🏽 and reading books about human psychology and self-growth like 'The 48 Laws of Power' and 'The Compound Effect' 📖. 
        But, something that stuck with me my whole life is music. My love for music can't be described in words. Some artists I love are The Weeknd, J. Cole, Michael Jackson and PNL but my absolute favourite is Kendrick Lamar 🎧.

        My burning passion for technology - as cliché as it sounds - pushed me to have very ambitious goals such as trying to become an exceptional full stack developer, get a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence and maybe, one day, use a quantum computer's power to accelerate deep learning algorithms.
        Currently, I'm almost done with my Computer Science degree but this is just the beginning for me. Like Monkey D. Luffy who spent more than 20 years on his search for the One Piece, I will continue learning and improving until I reach these goals. What an adventure this is going to be!

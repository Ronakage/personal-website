    desc="My second internship was very challenging and I was tested on everything I've learned so far, something that I appreciate a lot since I love being challenged. At this trading firm, I was working on refactoring and revamping a desktop application using .NET (C#). The old application was incomplete, not clean, not interactive and very janky. It was used by the traders of the company as a dashboard to look up charts and forecasted information coming from the data science team. Also, I worked on refactoring SQL queries to speed up their execution times. I proposed and implemented a React web application to monitor the database's health and web scraping jobs too. In the end, I was the only intern who has been offered a return offer."

    date="Summer 2021 (May - August)"
    desc="My first internship was my first exposure to a real-life software development lifecycle. I gained a lot of experience from my co-workers and I learned how to be a useful team player by cooperating with the other intern to tackle what seemed like impossible tasks at that time. Also, I learned the importance of soft skills and how communication can make or break a project. I wrote automation scripts using Python in order to automate manual tests, saving hundreds of wasted hours in my department. I scored 4.9/5 in my intern evaluation report as a result."

    title="Sciences informatiques et mathématiques DEC @ Collège de Bois-de-Boulogne"
    date="August 2018 - May 2020"
    desc="This DEC (Diplome d'études collégiales) strengthened my preexisting knowledge in programming. Programming was only a self-taught hobby for me before this degree. I learned Object-Oriented Programming and Game Development using Java. At the end of the degree, I worked with the city of Pointe-Claire and the University of Montreal on a graduation project that helps students with special needs to reach out to their professors and do their homework. This project was my introduction to full stack development and the stack used was Flutter, Express.js, MongoDB Atlas."
